Build and Host a Mini Course Subscription Application (Black-Friday Edition)

Objective
Develop a full-stack web application where users can sign up, view courses, and subscribe based on whether a course is free or paid. The application must include a frontend, backend, database, and cloud hosting.

🔔 Important: No real payments are required. Everything should be mock-based.
Even for paid courses, the promo code simply reduces the mock price.

Go To Guidelines:

Submission
Guidelines:


1. Authentication:
The application must be secured with authentication, using either JWT or a session token. It is not required to implement full authentication flows such as user registration. A simple login page with a few pre-created users is sufficient, Just include the 2 to 3 dummy user credentials in your submission.
2. Frontend (React):
Build the following pages:
List of Pages Should be Created:
Signup + Login 
Home Page - Where the user can purchase courses
My Course Page - Lists all the courses the user is enrolled in
Course Details Page
The detailed requirements of each page are outlined below:
📄 Signup + Login Page 
Fields:
Email

Password

Name (optional)

Requirements:
Basic form validation

Call backend auth APIs

Store JWT token in localStorage/sessionStorage

Redirect to Home after login

📄 Home Page
Display a list of at least 5 courses(Use Mock data), each containing:
Title

Description

Price (Free or Paid)

Thumbnail image (optional but recommended)

Each card should link to the Course Detail Page.

📄 Course Detail Page
Display:
Course title

Full description

Price

Course image (optional)

Subscription Logic:
If the course is FREE
Show “Subscribe” button

Allow instant subscription (no promo required)

If the course is PAID
Show the following:
Promo code input box

“Apply Promo Code” button

“Subscribe” button (disabled until promo is validated)

Valid Promo Code which gives 50% discount is - BFSALE25 
Remember: Payment is mock-only (no real payment integration required).

📄 My Courses Page
Show all courses the user subscribed to, including:
Course title

Price paid

Subscription date

Thumbnail (optional)

Styling (Optional But Recommended)
TailwindCSS or Bootstrap

Clean UI

Toast notifications for success/fail actions


3. Backend (Node.js + Express)
Build the following APIs:
Auth

GET /courses/:id - fetch one course by ID

Subscriptions
POST /subscribe
Backend Subscription Logic
Check course type

If free → allow subscription instantly

If paid → ensure promo code is provided

4. Database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
Required tables/collections:
Users: id, name, email, password (hashed)
Courses: id, title, description, price (0 = free), image(optional)
Subscriptions: id, userId, courseId, pricePaid, subscribedAt

The routes and schema provided are for illustration purposes only. It is not mandatory to follow the exact schema.

Better promo validation UX

Loading states and skeletons

Responsive design

Error boundary pages

Add images for courses for better UI

Protect routes using auth middleware

Display original price vs discounted price

5. Hosting & Deployment

Deploy the code snippets (working solution) on a cloud instance or web hosting service of choice.


6. Submission Guidelines
Share a GitHub repository with well-structured and documented code.
Provide a live hosted link to the working application.
Include a README file with setup instructions for local development and deployment. Screenshots of the main pages (signup, courses list, course detail, my courses) are recommended.
